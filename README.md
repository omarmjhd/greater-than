# We're >

## You are defined by yourself, not your disease.

J.P. Morgan Code For Good New York 2015

##Description

We're > is a web application that was created at J.P. Morgan Code For Good New York 2015 for Keep A Child Alive, an NGO striving to combat the physical, social and economic impacts of HIV. It strives to create a social network for HIV positive young adults where they can connect with others, gain more information about their disease and how to manage it, and see events that other users are putting on in their area.

##Technology

The application lives on a MEAN stack with a front-end that uses Bootstrap to assist with its design. In its current state, it can be run locally on a machine that has MongoDB, and Node.js installed.
